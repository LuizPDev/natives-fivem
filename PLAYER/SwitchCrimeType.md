## _SWITCH_CRIME_TYPE

```c
// 0x9A987297ED8BD838 0x59B5C2A2
void _SWITCH_CRIME_TYPE(Player player, int p1);
```

```
This was previously named as "RESERVE_ENTITY_EXPLODES_ON_HIGH_EXPLOSION_COMBO"  
which is obviously incorrect.  
Seems to only appear in scripts used in Singleplayer. p1 ranges from 2 - 46.  
I assume this switches the crime type  
```

## Parameters
* **player**: 
* **p1**:
