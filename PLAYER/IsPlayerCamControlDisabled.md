## _IS_PLAYER_CAM_CONTROL_DISABLED

```c
// 0x7C814D2FB49F40C0
BOOL _IS_PLAYER_CAM_CONTROL_DISABLED();
```

```
Returns true when the player is not able to control the cam i.e. when running a benchmark test, switching the player or viewing a cutscene.  
Note: I am not 100% sure if the native actually checks if the cam control is disabled but it seems promising.  
```

## Return value
