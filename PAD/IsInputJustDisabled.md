## _IS_INPUT_JUST_DISABLED

```c
// 0x13337B38DB572509
BOOL _IS_INPUT_JUST_DISABLED(int inputGroup);
```

```
I may be wrong with this one, but from the looks of the scripts, it sets keyboard related stuff as soon as this returns true.  
0, 1 and 2 used in the scripts. 0 is by far the most common of them.  
```

## Parameters
* **inputGroup**: 

## Return value
