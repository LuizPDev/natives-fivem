## SET_ENABLE_BOUND_ANKLES

```c
// 0xC52E0F855C58FC2E 0x9208D689
void SET_ENABLE_BOUND_ANKLES(Ped ped, BOOL toggle);
```

Used with [SET_ENABLE_HANDCUFFS](#_0xDF1AF8B5D56542FA) in decompiled scripts. From my observations, I have noticed that while being ragdolled you are not able to get up but you can still run. Your legs can also bend.

## Parameters
* **ped**: 
* **toggle**:
