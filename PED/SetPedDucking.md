## SET_PED_DUCKING

```c
// 0x030983CA930B692D 0xB90353D7
void SET_PED_DUCKING(Ped ped, BOOL toggle);
```

```
This is the SET_CHAR_DUCKING from GTA IV, that makes Peds duck. This function does nothing in GTA V. It cannot set the ped as ducking in vehicles, and IS_PED_DUCKING will always return false.  
```

## Parameters
* **ped**: 
* **toggle**:
