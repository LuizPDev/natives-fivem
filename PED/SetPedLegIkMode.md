## SET_PED_LEG_IK_MODE

```c
// 0xC396F5B86FF9FEBD 0xFDDB042E
void SET_PED_LEG_IK_MODE(Ped ped, int mode);
```

```
"IK" stands for "Inverse kinematics." I assume this has something to do with how the ped uses his legs to balance. In the scripts, the second parameter is always an int with a value of 2, 0, or sometimes 1  
```

## Parameters
* **ped**: 
* **mode**:
