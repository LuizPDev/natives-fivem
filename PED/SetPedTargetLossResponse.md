## SET_PED_TARGET_LOSS_RESPONSE

```c
// 0x0703B9079823DA4A 0xCFA613FF
void SET_PED_TARGET_LOSS_RESPONSE(Ped ped, int responseType);
```

```
Only 1 and 2 appear in the scripts. combatbehaviour.meta seems to only have TLR_SearchForTarget for all peds, but we don't know if that's 1 or 2.  
```

## Parameters
* **ped**: 
* **responseType**:
