-----  
Hardcoded to not work in Multiplayer.  
------  
Which I'm sure can easily be bypassed by nop'ing the branch preventing it from working if you are in multiplayer lol. Which would still be pointless since you don't need this to make peds do what you wish.  
```

## Parameters
* **name**: 
* **model**: 
* **p2**: 
* **p3**:
