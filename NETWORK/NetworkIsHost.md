```c
// 0x8DB296B814EDDA07 0xE46AC10F
BOOL NETWORK_IS_HOST();

If you are host, returns true else returns false.  
anyone know how to use this to find correct host? is possible?  
go to a mission and it will set a host then search the host name using a program then find the pointer to the host name  
```
