## _NETWORK_SET_NETWORK_ID_DYNAMIC

```c
// 0x2B1813ABA29016C5 0x155465EE
void _NETWORK_SET_NETWORK_ID_DYNAMIC(int netID, BOOL toggle);
```

```
This is called shortly after setting Network ID Migration off it seems. Does anyone know the point of this?   
Example scenario,   
If I were to request and gain control of an online players vehicle then their vehicle's Network ID and turn migration off. I wouldn't need to ever request control again as they wouldn't gain control back.   
- scenario over -  
So what would be the point hereafter of setting it 'dynamic'?  
```

## Parameters
* **netID**: 
* **toggle**:
