## _0xADED7F5748ACAFE6

```c
// 0xADED7F5748ACAFE6 0x1D6859CA
void _0xADED7F5748ACAFE6();
```

Displays "normal" notifications again after calling `_0x56C8B608CFD49854` (those that were drawn before calling this native too), though those will have a weird offset and stay on screen forever (tested with notifications created from same script).
