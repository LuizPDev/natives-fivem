## TASK_HANDS_UP

```c
// 0xF2EAB31979A7F910 0x8DCC19C5
void TASK_HANDS_UP(Ped ped, int duration, Ped facingPed, int p3, BOOL p4);
```

```
In the scripts, p3 was always -1.  
p3 seems to be duration or timeout of turn animation.  
Also facingPed can be 0 or -1 so ped will just raise hands up.  
```

## Parameters
* **ped**: 
* **duration**: 
* **facingPed**: 
* **p3**: 
* **p4**:
