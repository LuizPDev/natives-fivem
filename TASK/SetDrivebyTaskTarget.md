## SET_DRIVEBY_TASK_TARGET

```c
// 0xE5B302114D8162EE 0xDA6A6FC1
void SET_DRIVEBY_TASK_TARGET(Ped shootingPed, Ped targetPed, Vehicle targetVehicle, float x, float y, float z);
```

```
For p1 & p2 (Ped, Vehicle). I could be wrong, as the only time this native is called in scripts is once and both are 0, but I assume this native will work like SET_MOUNTED_WEAPON_TARGET in which has the same exact amount of parameters and the 1st and last 3 parameters are right and the same for both natives.  
```

## Parameters
* **shootingPed**: 
* **targetPed**: 
* **targetVehicle**: 
* **x**: 
* **y**: 
* **z**:
