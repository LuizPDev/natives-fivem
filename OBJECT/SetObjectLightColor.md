## _SET_OBJECT_LIGHT_COLOR

```c
// 0x5F048334B4A4E774
Any _SET_OBJECT_LIGHT_COLOR(Object object, BOOL p1, int r, int g, int b);
```

Seems to set the colour of the prop. Haven't really tested it on other props.
Only appears in am_mp_nightclub.c for the nightclub dancefloor.

Not sure what p1 does, seems to only ever be '1' in scripts.
