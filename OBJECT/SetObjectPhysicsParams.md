## SET_OBJECT_PHYSICS_PARAMS

```c
// 0xF6DF6E90DE7DF90F 0xE8D11C58
void SET_OBJECT_PHYSICS_PARAMS(Object object, float weight, float p2, float p3, float p4, float p5, float gravity, float p7, float p8, float p9, float p10, float buoyancy);
```

```
Adjust the physics parameters of a prop, or otherwise known as "object". This is useful for simulated gravity.  
Other parameters seem to be unknown.  
p2: seems to be weight and gravity related. Higher value makes the obj fall faster. Very sensitive?  
p3: seems similar to p2  
p4: makes obj fall slower the higher the value  
p5: similar to p4  
```
