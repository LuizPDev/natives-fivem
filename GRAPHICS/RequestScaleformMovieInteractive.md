## _REQUEST_SCALEFORM_MOVIE_INTERACTIVE

```c
// 0xBD06C611BB9048C2
int _REQUEST_SCALEFORM_MOVIE_INTERACTIVE(char* scaleformName);
```

```
Similar to REQUEST_SCALEFORM_MOVIE, but seems to be some kind of "interactive" scaleform movie?  
These seem to be the only scaleforms ever requested by this native:  
"breaking_news"  
"desktop_pc"  
"ECG_MONITOR"  
"Hacking_PC"  
"TEETH_PULLING"  
Note: Unless this hash is out-of-order, this native is next-gen only.  
```

## Parameters
* **scaleformName**:
