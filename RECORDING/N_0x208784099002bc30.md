## _0x208784099002BC30

```c
// 0x208784099002BC30
void _0x208784099002BC30(char* missionNameLabel, Any p1);
```

```
-This function appears to be deprecated/ unused. Tracing the call internally leads to a _nullsub -  
first one seems to be a string of a mission name, second one seems to be a bool/toggle  
p1 was always 0.  
```

## Parameters
* **missionNameLabel**: 
* **p1**:
