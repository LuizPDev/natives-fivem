## _0x19AF7ED9B9D23058

```c
// 0x19AF7ED9B9D23058 0xA58BBF4F
void _0x19AF7ED9B9D23058();
```

```
RELEASE_???  
I say RELEASE_???, as in IDA this native calls the same function as   
-'RELEASE_MISSION_AUDIO_BANK()'.  
-'RELEASE_AMBIENT_AUDIO_BANK()'.  
-'RELEASE_SCRIPT_AUDIO_BANK()'.  
However 'RELEASE_NAMED_SCRIPT_AUDIO_BANK' does not use the same function. So may be, 'RELEASE_???_AUDIO_BANK()'? Doubt it.
